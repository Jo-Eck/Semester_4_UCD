## History of UNIX

- UNIX was developed in 1969 at AT&T Bell Labs by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.
  - Back then it was called Multics.
  - It was originally developed for the PDP-7 minicomputer.
  
- The C programming language was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972.
  - C was originally developed for the UNIX operating system.
  - The entire UNIX operating then was rewritten in C.

- Because of all the diverging OperatingSystems the IEEE decided to standardize the software under the POSIX standard
  - The POSIX standard is a set of standards for maintaining compatibility between operating systems.
  - POSIX is an acronym for Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) of UNIX.

  - To be POSIX compliant, an operating system must provide a standard set of interfaces to the system's services.
  
- In the wake of openly distributed Operating systems a standard set of tools was also create the GNU project
