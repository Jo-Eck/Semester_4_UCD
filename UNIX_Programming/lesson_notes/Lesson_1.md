## History of UNIX

- UNIX was developed in 1969 at AT&T Bell Labs by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.
  - Back then it was called Multics.
  - It was originally developed for the PDP-7 minicomputer.
  
- The C programming language was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972.
  - C was originally developed for the UNIX operating system.
  - The entire UNIX operating then was rewritten in C.

- Because of all the diverging OperatingSystems the IEEE decided to standardize the software under the POSIX standard
  - The POSIX standard is a set of standards for maintaining compatibility between operating systems.
  - POSIX is an acronym for Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) of UNIX.

  - To be POSIX compliant, an operating system must provide a standard set of interfaces to the system's services.
  
- In the wake of openly distributed Operating systems a standard set of tools was also create the GNU project

## What is UNIX?

- Operating system developed in 1969 by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and others at AT&T Bell Labs
- Killer features:
  - Multi-user
  - Multi-tasking
  - Portable!!

### Unix philosophy

- Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
- Write programs to work together.
- Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

## Unix wars and the GNU project

### Unix wars

- AT&T licensed UNIX to universities for free.
- But AT&T was bought by Novell and they started charging for UNIX.
- This led to the development of competing UNIX operating systems
  - First BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)
  - Then Linux (Linus Torvalds) + GNU (Richard Stallman)3
- Resulted in the POSIX standard (Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) of UNIX)

### GNU project

- GNU is an acronym for GNU's Not UNIX
- GNU is a project to create a free operating system
- GNU is a collection of tools to make a complete operating system

### Linux

- Linux is a Kernel not an operating system.
- Linux is a UNIX clone
- Linux is supplied with GNU tools to make it a complete operating system
- Developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991
- Linux is open source


## Open Source vs Free Software


### Open Source

- Developed in the 80s
- Open source software is software that can be freely used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone.
- Open source software is made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition.
- Open source software is usually developed as a public collaboration and made freely available.
- Can be used for commercial purposes.

### Free Software

- Developed in the 90s
- Opens source with a political agenda
- Free software is software that can be freely used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone.
- Free software is made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the Free Software Definition.
- More restrictive than open source
