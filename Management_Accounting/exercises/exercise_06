# Exercise 06

## Consider a house or apartment share, how should the following be shared?

Rent – By sqaremeters pers person
Electricity - if seperate meters are there, by use else one share per person
Broadband –  by data used per person, overhead is being shared equally
TV package - equally
Bin charges - equally
TV Licence - equally
Food - everyone buys their own
Heating Costs - equally, unless agreed otherwise.

## Does the method you use to share costs matter? Why?

making sure to allocate the overhead costs according to the actuall product,
makes sure that the cost will actually be covered when the products are sold.

## Will the method you select affect the total cost incurred?

the total cost should stay the same, just the pricing of the sold products will change.
but it creates an incentive to use more than your fair share, if this cost can be offloaded to others.
