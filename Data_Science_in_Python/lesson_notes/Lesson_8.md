## Time series data

Usually datasets are not actually fixed. As they continuously grow and change, we need to be able to handle them. This is where time series data comes in. Time series data is a set of data points indexed in time order. Usually, the data is recorded at regular intervals. This is called a time series. The data points can be anything, like the temperature, the stock price of a company, the number of visitors on a website, etc.

## Patterns

### Regular patterns

Regular patterns are patterns that repeat at regular intervals. For example, the temperature of an area is usually higher in the summer than in the winter. This is a regular pattern. The temperature is higher in the summer than in the winter, and this happens every year. This is a regular pattern that repeats every year.

### Irregular patterns

Irregular patterns are special events that happen at irregular intervals. For example, a stock price can go up or down at any time. This is an irregular pattern. The stock price can go up or down at any time, and this happens at irregular intervals. This is an irregular pattern that happens at irregular intervals.

## How to analyze time series data

### Visualizing time series data

The first step in analyzing time series data is to visualize it. This is because it is easier to see patterns in a graph than in a table.
This is especially true when comparing multiple time series. For example, if we want to compare the temperature in two different cities, we can plot the temperature in each city on the same graph. This makes it easier to see the differences between the two cities.

### what is the trend?

The trend is the general direction in which the data is moving. For example, if the temperature is increasing, the trend is up. If the temperature is decreasing, the trend is down. If the temperature is staying the same, the trend is flat.

## Chraracteristics of time series data

* Is the source equaly spaced?
* How noisy is the data?
* Is the data stationary?
* How narrow is our window of interest?

## Stationarity

A time series is stationary if its statistical properties such as mean, variance, autocorrelation, etc. are all constant over time. If a time series is not stationary, it is non-stationary. Non-stationary time series can be made stationary by transforming them. This is called differencing.
