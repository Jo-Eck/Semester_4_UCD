# Data Science in Python Lesson 1

## Datatypes

- Types of data in Python:
  - Primitive:
    - int (integer)
    - float (floating point number)
    - bool (boolean)
    - str (string) indicated by single or double quotes

  - Non-primitive:
    - list
    - tuple
    - dict
    - set
  
## Arythmetic Operators

- \+ (addition)
- \- (subtraction)
- \* (multiplication)
- / (division)
- % (modulus)
- ** (exponentiation)
- // (floor division)

## Comparison Operators

- == (equal to)
- != (not equal to)
- \> (greater than)
- < (less than)
- \>= (greater than or equal to)
- <= (less than or equal to)

## Boolean Operators

- and
- or
- not

## Data Structure

### Lists

- Lists are mutable, ordered sequences of elements
- Values are accessed by index
- mutable: can be changed
- nesting is possible

### Tuples

- Tuples are immutable, ordered sequences of elements
- indexing is possible

### Sets

- Sets are unordered collections of unique elements
- can be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference
- can be modified by adding or removing elements

### Dictionaries

- Dictionaries are unordered key-value pairs
- can be nested
- can be modified by adding or removing elements
- associated functions: keys(), values(), items()
